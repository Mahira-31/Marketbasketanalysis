# Market Basket Analysis using Association Rule- Apriori Algorithm and Eclat Algorithm
This project explores Market Basket Analysis (MBA), a data mining technique used to uncover associations between products in transactional datasets. 
It focuses on implementing and comparing two popular algorithms: Apriori and Eclat.

Apriori Algorithm: Generates frequent itemsets using the downward closure property and derives association rules to identify product relationships. The implementation includes customizable parameters such as minimum support and confidence.

Eclat Algorithm: A depth-first search algorithm that finds frequent itemsets by calculating itemset intersections, offering an alternative approach to Apriori.

Datasets:
-groceries.csv and items.csv datasets for Apriori analysis
-An inbuilt sample dataset and eclat.csv for Eclat algorithm testing

Objective: To analyze purchasing patterns and uncover meaningful insights for retail strategies.

Python (pandas, mlxtend, itertools, etc.)
GitHub for code versioning and sharing
Jupyter Notebooks for interactive experimentation

To be more specific, 4 jupyter notebooks are attached that includes the implementation.
