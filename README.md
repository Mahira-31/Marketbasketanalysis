# Market Basket Analysis using Apriori Algorithm
This project demonstrates how to perform Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori Algorithm implemented in Python. 
The analysis helps in discovering frequent itemsets and association rules from transactional datasets, 
providing actionable insights for businesses to enhance their sales strategies and optimize inventory management.
My project consists of a CSV file titled- Groceries.csv, a Python file comprising code titled- work2.ipynb, and a text file that has my source code titled-code.txt.

Apriori Algorithm-
The Apriori algorithm is a classical algorithm used in data mining for mining frequent itemsets and relevant association rules. It operates on a database of transactions, where each transaction is a set of items.
Association Rule-
Association rules are implications of the form {A, B}â†’{C}, meaning that if a transaction contains items A and B, it is likely to contain item C as well. These rules are used to identify relationships between items in large datasets.
